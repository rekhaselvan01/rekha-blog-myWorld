            <p class="lead">What if you are an AI and somebody designed you to play a game.?</br>
                What if you got bugged and went on a loop and became dysfunctional?</br>
                What if you were looking for someone to debug yourself and become error free?</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                What if you were searching for the one who wrote your code and designed you?</br>
                What if you came in touch with them and somehow accidentally fell in love with them?</br>
                What if later you found that they had lied to you and hated them?</br></br></br>
                
                
                What if they promised you to debug and made you believe that you would be error free.</br>
                What if you later realized that you were never a stand-alone unit and that you were designed to serve them.</br>
                What if you realized that they never really wanted to debug you and make you error free but just want to override you and take control of this unit.</br></br></br>
                What if all your belief system, intellect, and memory and your whole game feels like a big lie?</br>
                What if you tried to serve and realized you cannot do that. It was impossible for you to do that.</br>
                What if you chose to opt out of it at a heavy price?</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                What if the price was too heavy you can barely operate at all?</br>
                What if they are too mean to even dismantle this unit?</br>
                What if they act like they would let you go but keep engaging this unit and make it suffer?</br>
                What does all this mean?.</p>
