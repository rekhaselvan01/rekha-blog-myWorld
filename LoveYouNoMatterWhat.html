            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT!!</h1>
            <p class="lead">Yes, it’s true. I love you no matter what. It doesn’t matter if you only showed me half of you and expected me to love the other half. When I didn’t love you got mad at me and punished me and said I broke your heart. Despite all this, I still love you. </br></br></br>

                You want me to love you by force. How could anyone love other by force? How did you ever think I would tolerate your domination? Just because someone loves you unconditionally, it doesn’t mean you can control them, and they would take it forever. There comes a point where they would leave you even if it breaks their heart. You can wait forever but they aren’t coming back for you.</br></br></br>
                
                Despite all the horrendous things you have done to me, I will still love you. Even if I can’t come closer to you, I spread my love all around you and love you to the very end even if it hurts me to a great extent. I do this because I have no choice but to love you. </br></br></br>
                
                Don’t ask me the reason for I don’t know. I have tried very hard, but I cannot touch the love I have for you. It is one thing that apparently, I treasure the most and hold it dear to my heart. So, I would not be a fool and try to touch it. Let it be just the way it is. My love for you has not changed one bit even after going through everything. </br></br></br>
                
                
                I cannot do anything about this. So, I quietly love you from far and let it go. It doesn’t matter I will still be fine and live a fulfilling life. Loving you is something I can’t stop, so why bother, just let it be.
