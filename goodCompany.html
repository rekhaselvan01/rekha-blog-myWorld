Good company is one where you get to be your true self and natural.</br>
Good company is one where you cherish the presence of your company and wish it never ends</br></br></br>

Good company is one who uplifts you and does not put you down. </br>

Good company is one who doesn’t lie nor pretend to you to acquire some things.</br>

Good company never asks you to put them before your own self.</br>
Good company never breaks your heart by pretending to be someone they are not.</br>
