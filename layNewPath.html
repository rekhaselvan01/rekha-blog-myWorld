            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">LAY A NEW PATH</h1>
            <p class="lead">I have spent my entire life walking the path that has been laid out for me. It was fun when I was a child. I felt protected and comfortable walking the laid-out path. I even felt secure, and everything felt right until I hit puberty and became a teenager. I did not like mindlessly memorizing tons of data in biology and physics. I did not see why I had to memorize these. It felt mundane and least interesting.</br></br></br> 


                In fact, I never even paid attention to plants or saw them as a life. Never thought those enzymes and those complex structures were fun. I absolutely hated it, but my parents made the choice for me. They picked my main branch of study, and I quietly accepted it. It was my fault for not making my own choice. </br></br></br>
        
                It was around sixteen when I found the educational system too boring and wanted to do anything but study. I wished I was born somewhere else so I could escape this system of education, but I simply accepted it and did what I could, barely passing and scoring average. </br></br></br>
        
                But life was still so beautiful and simple. I was a hopeless romantic and a strong believer of one person meant for another. Now as an adult I know it is just a fantasy or concept, but people change and adapt with times whereas some people are caught up in the old times. </br></br></br>
        
                At this junction of life, I feel like an old-timer caught up between two different worlds and not able to make a jump. The heart and mind are set on those values and principles, and they are engrained into my soul, forcing them to change is worse than death. If someone comes along and forces you to change yourself to fit their world and ways of life, what would you do at this junction of life? </br></br></br>
        
        
                Instead of asking silly questions to myself as to “how do people change with the ways of life and adapt?” and “why can’t I be like other people?” and “why is all this happening to me?”, I finally have learnt to respect my own self and my emotions. </br></br></br>
        
                If I love myself enough, I will never ask myself such questions. Why should I change for someone or something. I am beautiful and perfect the way I am. I have the freedom to make my choice and lay a new path if I can’t walk this path. I must learn to drop the things I don’t like and pick and choose the ones I like.</br></br></br>
        
        
                There is no pain I can’t bear and get through. Nor am I naïve enough to sit and wish for glorious happy days. I have learned to accept my life and don’t want to change anything. Just want to get through this and walk my own path quietly and peacefully. </br></br></br>
        
        
                I prefer to get out and do something rather than suffer and cry on useless things. Nothing is going to change anyway, so I better change myself and lay out my own path.
