            <p class="lead">Passion is weakness for it makes you hold on to someone or something so tight and protect that person or thing from being taken away from you. It is the worst feeling in the world because from my own experience I have done passion my entire life. Holding on tight to my parents and then husband and kids and everything in between. Trying so hard to keep people and things to be safe and protected is pure madness. I am not God, and I can’t control situations and circumstances. No matter how hard I try I cannot protect my loved ones or things from world happenings. </br></br></br>


                It took me all my life to understand this simple truth of life. I feel like a fool having wasted all my energy in trying to keep people and things safe. Life is nothing but constant change and I cannot fight the change or struggle to keep things the same. This is not the right way to live life.</br></br></br>
                
                All you can do is play your part and do your best as a wife, mother, and daughter. Then leave the rest to the world. Nature takes care of itself, and no one is helpless. Everyone is protected by nature and cared for. It’s time for me to just do my job and sit back and relax.
