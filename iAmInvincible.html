    <h1>I AM INVINCIBLE!!</h1>

        When you are pushed to your ultimate limit and you want to jump off a cliff, that’s when you really see your strength. There is a voice in your head that says, “are you kidding me?”.</br> </br></br> 

        I suddenly realize how silly the pain is. And how silly the problem is? Suddenly there is a sense of relief and self-realization dawns. </br></br></br>
        
        I feel an indescribable inner strength that tells me how strong I am? This situation is nothing in front of me. The situation is like a housefly, and I am elephant, strong and majestic. No one and nothing can touch me. “I am invincible after all”.
