    <h1>HOW COULD I LIVE?</h1>
    <p>

        How could I live?</br>
        How do I carry on?</br>
        How do I sleep?</br>
        How can I forget?</br>
        How can I let go?</br>
        How can I move on?</br></br></br>
        
        Who do I go to for comfort?</br>
        Who do I express all my love to?</br>
        Who do I talk to?</br>
        Who do I lean on to?</br>
        Who do I have faith onto?</br>
        Who do I look for wherever I go?</br></br></br>
        
        Did you think I can bear this pain?</br>
        Did you think I could move on?</br>
        Did you think I like suffering?</br>
        Did you think I had no feelings?</br>
        Did you think I can forget everything?</br></br></br>
        
        Is it because you like drama?</br>
        Is it because you want revenge?</br>
        Is it because you hate me?</br>
        Is it because you like to control me?</br>
        Is it because you donâ€™t really care?</br></br></br>
        
        
        I guess you like watching me suffer like hell </br>
        I guess you thought I would never leave </br>
        I guess you took me for granted </br>
        I guess you thought you could abuse me because I loved you like crazy </br></br></br>
        
        
        I guess you wanted to control me and still wanted me to love you </br>
        I guess you know nothing about love </br>
        I guess all you know is to control 
        </p>
