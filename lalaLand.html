            <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">STOP LIVING IN LA LA LAND!</h1>
            <p class="lead">I realize that I have lived in la-la land for most of my adult life. No wonder I found my life was too hard and disappointing. Most of the time, I felt things never went the way I wanted and now I know why. I have lived far from reality, and it hurts like hell to finally wake up and see the reality.</br></br></br>

                It takes much more than courage to live in this world, it takes tenacity and acceptance. I have struggled with acceptance for half of my life and when I look back now, I feel like a complete fool. </br></br></br>
                
                
                I have liked like a child with wild imagination for most of my life and far away from reality. Now that I have been forced to face it, I am in living hell and want to escape this nightmare. But I can’t go any further like this, it’s time for me to accept the world the way it is. I am not in control, and I can’t control anything around me. All I can control is how I react and respond to people and things around me. I have been wanting everyone and everything to be in a certain way but that is never going to happen. </br></br></br>
                
                The world is prone to constant change whether good or bad, whether I like it or not, it’s going to happen. It’s better to let it go and stop controlling something I have no control over. Also, I have no control over my life, all I could do is give my hundred percent and hope things turn out better. If they don’t, at least I don’t have to live with regrets and doubts.</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                I need to stop expecting things that are unreal and never prone to happen. It’s time for me to grow up and stop being ridiculous. Being naïve is beautiful but as a human if I don’t learn after multiple experiences then that naivety turns into foolishness and causes misery. It’s high time for me to stop being foolish and accept people and things the way they really are. It’s time for me to stop expecting things that are impossible. Even if it hurts like hell, let me slap myself and wake myself before it’s too late.</br></br></br>
