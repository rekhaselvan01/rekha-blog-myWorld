    <h1>THE BIGGER THE PAIN, THE STRONGER YOU BECOME!</h1>

    <p>



        My problem looked impossible, unbearable, and felt unsolvable, never ending, and justifiable to end my life. It felt like my situation is strange and unique. No one can understand how I feel, nor could anyone help me out of this situation. I cried a river and then peace dawned on me. I could see “I was wrong”. </br></br></br>

        Neither is my problem big, nor my situation impossible. It was me who gave it power and I have absolute control over how I handle it.</br></br>
•	        Option one: I can either fight it, resent it, or try to escape it.  </br></br>
•	        Option two: I can simply face it, accept it, bear it, and accommodate it and be with it.</br></br></br>

        Soon I realized, I can bear any amount of pain and that it only makes me stronger. I rather see this as an obstacle course where you can make your way through a tiny space. </br></br></br>

        You just need to learn how to crawl in tight spaces, jump in open space and dive right into water to come out of it. Overall, this obstacle course has brought out so many qualities in me that never would have come otherwise. So “thank you pain, thank you obstacle course “.
