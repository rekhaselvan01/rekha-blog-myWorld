            <p class="lead">Loneliness is a strange feeling. I always thought I was lonely when I did not have company. If I did not have someone to talk to, or someone to eat meals with, or someone to go walking, or someone to go shopping, I thought I was lonely. I looked at other people and wondered how they always have friends to walk with, eat meals with, go to places while I am always alone even though I had family. I had just few friends and even with them, I could never really find the company I was looking for.</br></br></br>


                Only now, it strikes me as to how ridiculous I was. Everything was made up in my own head. I was never alone. I always had myself to eat, play, do activities and go to places. I never thought of myself as a good company worthy of spending time with. Instead sat around and waited for some third person to pop up into my life and tried so hard to make friends. what an idiot I have been? </br></br></br>
                
                I am never alone, I have myself to care and take me out of any situation. I am my best company. I’m the one who really knows what I want, cares for me and wants good things in life. I am my only true well-wisher. This is applicable to every human being not just me. This is true because no one else other than yourself can know what you want and make it happen. </br></br></br>
                
                
                I just learnt this lesson yesterday, when I went to the park with my kids and puppy. My puppy Sunny teaches me a lot of life lessons. I simply observe her behavior and see myself in her. She is such a heart-warming adorable puppy who is nothing less than a beautiful child. She can be your true companion if you simply love her. When she goes to park, she runs to other dogs for company. She thinks she is lonely and needs company which is natural. But somehow most dog owners are too protective of their dogs and won’t let them say hello to Sunny. This made her very upset and sad. She felt like no one likes her or that she is not good enough of a company. She was even barking for attention, and I felt bad for her and realized how ridiculous this scenario is. </br></br></br>
                
                
                
                She is such a beautiful thing, and anyone could find comfort and solace with that beautiful thing. She is so full of love capable of loving anyone endlessly. She is a gift to anyone who comes near her. But the sad part is she does not know about herself. She thinks she is lonely, and no one cares for her company. But I know the truth about her, and I know her value.</br></br></br>
                
                
                I have been in the similar situation. I always thought that I was not good enough for people to spend time with me. I was not good enough to get some friends or have company. Such a fool I had been. I did not know about myself, and I did not take time to understand myself. I never sat and analyzed what I wanted or what was my interests. I have only learnt to live for others and mold myself around their needs, likes and dislikes. So, I only know how to live for others and worry about their happiness. I thought that is what I was supposed to do. Naturally I was unhappy and who would make friends with an unhappy person.</br></br></br>
                
                Finally, I am learning to live for myself. It does not mean I am going to abandon others. I simply put myself first and then take care of others. This is the right way to live. All my life lessons are basic things which most of the people would do naturally. No learning or teaching necessary. If you have common sense, you will do this naturally. Apparently, I don’t have much common sense to understand such simple things.</br></br></br>
                
                
                I am finally learning to understand myself, understand my needs, understand my likes and dislikes, and do the things I wanted to do. I have finally gathered the courage to believe in myself and always lean on myself. When you lean or someone or something, it’s going to cost you and it still might not really be the best arrangement. It’s not because they are evil, but because they have a mind of their own and they have their own needs. It is natural and nothing to complain about. </br></br></br>
                
                
                Learning: I was never lonely to begin with, nor my company too bad for others. It was all in my head. All I had to do was to look at myself and focus on myself.
