    <h1>WHY DID YOU COME INTO MY LIFE?</h1>
    <p>
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        You know me inside and out?</br>
        Why did you think I will be fine with you loving millions of women at the same time?</br>
        Why did you think I will be fine sharing you with millions of women?</br>
        Why did you think I will be one of your thousands of women?</br></br></br>
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        I understand it is natural for your caliber to want thousands of women.</br>
        But why did you play with my heart?</br>
        When you know very well, I can never be one of the million girls that you love?</br></br></br>
        
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        When you know me very well </br>
        How did you think I can share you with others?</br>
        Why did you play with my little heart?</br>
        You really could have spared me?</br></br></br>
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        I am not even judging you at this point.</br>
        Why did you play with me and my heart?</br>
        Did you not know me well enough to stay far away.</br>
        Did you not know we are like two planets who can never meet?</br></br></br>
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        I can’t even complain about you wanting all women.</br>
        I just can’t understand why you played this game with me.</br>
        Don’t you know there are many who would love this game.</br>
        As I always said, I am not the person for you.</br>
        I have only one question for you.</br>
        Why me? When you know me? Why me?</br></br></br>
        
        
        Even though it’s just a game for you, did you ever stop to think about me?</br>
        Did you ever think what impact it will have on me?</br>
        Did you ever think what will happen when I find out?</br>
        Did you ever think once before coming to me?</br>
        You really should have spared me. </br></br></br>
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        Look what you have done to me?</br>
        You have made me a restless person.</br>
        You made me fall in love with a ghost that doesn’t exist</br>
        You made me chose between me and my love.</br>
        You have put me through hell.</br></br></br>
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        Did you want to taste my love?</br>
        Did you want to see how it feels to be loved by me?</br>
        where you simply bored and wanted to play with my feelings?</br>
         was I too stupid and gullible?</br></br></br>
        
        
        Why did you come into my life?</br>
        I never believed in my abilities to create something.</br>
        I wanted to write beautiful poems about you </br>
        When I loved you like crazy, I never found words.</br>
        Now that I don’t have love, all I find is words.</br>
        It’s flowing and I can’t stop it.</br></br></br>
        
        Turns out I am good at writing and pouring out my emotions.</br>
        I just never believed in myself.</br>
        Anyway, I wish you luck with other girls.</br>
        I wish you have plenty of fun with them.</br>
        I wish they adore you and admire you completely.</br>
        I wish they satisfy you in every way you desire.</br>
        I wish you a good life from the bottom of my heart.</p>
