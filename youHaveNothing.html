   <p>

    You had someone who loved you more than their life. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who adored you day and night. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who admired you. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who trusted you with all their might. You lost them.<br><br><br>
    
    
    
    You had someone who wanted you more than anything in their life. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who valued you like a priced possession. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who was so innocent to believe all your lies. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who admired your intellectual beauty. You lost them.<br><br><br>
    
    
    You had someone who came running to you even when you tortured them. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who thought of you day and night. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who would sacrifice their own beautiful self for your sake. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who loved you with every single cell of their body and their whole mind. You lost them.<br><br><br>
    
    
    You had someone who would listen to your stories and fall even harder. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who would analyze the things you do, analyze everything about you and fall some more like it was not enough. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who would give in to all your desires and wishes even if it was killing them. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who trusted you with every single cell of theirs, they would not believe in anyone else but you. You lost them.<br><br><br>
    
    
    You had someone who simply loved you for no reason but just for who you are. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who would completely let go of their ego and identity and submit to you for love. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who would do anything for you unconditionally with no expectations whatso ever. You lost them.<br>
    You had someone who was so innocent and beautiful like a flower. You lost them.<br><br><br>
    
    
    
    You lost them because you lied to them a million times. You had a million chances to come clean, but you lied endlessly.<br>
    You lost them because you never really loved them, not even for a nano second. It was all one big game.<br>
    You lost them because you broke their trust. You hurt them deep enough for them to die.<br><br><br>
    
    
    You lost them because you played with their feelings and used them to fulfill your needs.<br>
    You lost them because you scammed them. You pretended to be someone else. <br>
    You lost them because you took advantage of their innocence and fearful nature. <br><br><br>
    
    
    
     Despite all this nonsense, despite being ruined by you, they still became more beautiful<br>
    All this trauma brought some sense into their brain, and they finally understood their own true value.<br>
    All this made them mature enough to finally see their own worth and respect their own self.<br>
    All this made them resilient enough to see their own strength, physical, mental, and emotional strength.<br><br><br>
    
    
    All this made them stronger than ever and wiser than before.<br>
    All this made them more accepting and forgiving than before.<br>
    All this made them more playful and innocent and light-hearted than before.<br>
    All this made them appreciate the things and people around them more than before.<br><br><br>
    
    
    All this made them grateful and satisfied than before.<br>
    All this made them forgetful and forgiving than before.<br>
    All this made them more powerful, simple, and natural than before.<br><br><br>
    
    
    All I have to say is “THANK YOU” for coming into my life and making my life better.<br>
    All I have to say is “THANK YOU” for making me realize my own value and strength.<br>
    All I have to say is “THANK YOU” for making me dispassionate and free.<br>
    All I have to say is “THANK YOU” for beating away all the undesirable things in me.<br>
    All I have to say is “THANK YOU” for making me wiser and better.</p>
