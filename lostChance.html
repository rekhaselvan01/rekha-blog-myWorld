    <h1>YOU LOST YOUR CHANCE!</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/IMG_3490 Medium.jpeg" alt="rose flower" />
    <p>
        You could have asked me for my life, and I would have killed myself instantly</br>
        I don’t care my love is asking I would just do it!!</br>
        I would have done that and not regretted at all.</br></br></br>
        
        
        In fact, I would have been happy to love someone like crazy</br>
        But you blew it all. You lost your chance at that kind of love</br>
        You broke every rule in the book of love and life and humanity</br></br></br>
        
        
        You lied to me every possible moment.</br>
        You pretended to be someone you are not.</br>
        You wanted to control me and take me over. </br></br></br>
        
        
        When has control ever brough love in life?</br>
        Your ego was hurt and so you wanted to take me down</br>
        You managed to take me over, but you couldn’t keep that love</br></br></br>
        
        
        
        After all the lies, scam, and control, all you have is your pride</br>
        You have inflicted so much pain into me, are you happy to win the battle?</br>
        Are you happy that you made me miserable and broke me?</br>
        Does it make you feel that you are in control?</br></br></br>
        
        
        
        Anyway, all I want to say is that you don’t deserve my love </br>
        After all you have done, you don’t deserve my pure love at all.</br>
        You can go and love yourself because that is what you are capable off.</br></br></br>
        
        
        
        You know I am falling in love with pain more than pleasure.</br>
        Because pain means I am paying my bills and debts to you. </p>
