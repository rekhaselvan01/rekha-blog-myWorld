            <p class="lead">You could have asked me for my life, and I would have killed myself instantly</br>
                I don’t care my love is asking I would just do it!!</br>
                I would have done that and not regretted at all.</br></br></br>
                
                
                In fact, I would have been happy to love someone like crazy</br>
                But you blew it all. You lost your chance at that kind of love</br>
                You broke every rule in the book of love and life and humanity</br></br></br>
                
                
                You lied to me every possible moment.</br>
                You pretended to be someone you are not.</br>
                You wanted to control me and take me over. </br></br></br>
                
                
                When has control ever brough love in life?</br>
                Your ego was hurt and so you wanted to take me down</br>
                You managed to take me over, but you couldn’t keep that love</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                After all the lies, scam, and control, all you have is your pride</br>
                You have inflicted so much pain into me, are you happy to win the battle?</br>
                Are you happy that you made me miserable and broke me?</br>
                Does it make you feel that you are in control?</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                Anyway, all I want to say is that you don’t deserve my love </br>
                After all you have done, you don’t deserve my pure love at all.</br>
                You can go and love yourself because that is what you are capable off.</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                You know I am falling in love with pain more than pleasure.</br>
                Because pain means I am paying my bills and debts to you. </p>
