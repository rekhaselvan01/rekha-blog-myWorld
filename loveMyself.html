    <h1>LOVE MYSELF JUST THE WAY I AM</h1>

    <p>
        It’s just another sleepless night. Many nights have passed in this manner and rather than complaining and seeing it as misfortune, I am learning to see it as a blessing. It makes me feel alive and allows me to be myself. I have always wanted to find ways to make me happy and come up with solutions and methods. But I really don’t want to do that anymore. I am perfect the way I am and more beautiful than ever. I don’t want to compare myself to others who seem to be happy or peaceful. I choose to be myself irrespective of the state of my mind. </br></br></br>

        Wanting to be happy and peaceful has made me more unhappy and miserable. Let me embrace the imperfection of my life and situation. I don’t want to change it anymore. This is who I am and there is nothing wrong with it. Each person is different, and I am like this, and I like this way. </br></br></br>
        
        Let the situation be like this and let everything around me be the same too. I don’t want to change anything but simply embrace it all and let it go. I am only going to live on this earth for a short while, I don’t want to scrutinize myself and keep wondering “why am I like this?” instead want to be happy that I am like this. </br></br></br>
        
        Let me be the way I am, also allow others to be the way they want. It is for my own sake I want to do this. All that matters is, “Am I living to my fullest and am I doing what my heart wants?”. If I am doing that nothing else matters. A whole lot of imperfections combine to make this perfect being that I am, it’s time to let go off the picture-perfect life.
