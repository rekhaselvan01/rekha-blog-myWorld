            <p class="lead">I wish you were not so beautiful</br>
                Then I would not be drawn to you</br>
                I would not have learnt that you have thorns all over you</br>
                Wish I could only see your beautiful side</br>
                Wish I could totally ignore your thorny side</br>
                But it has impossible for me to do that</br></br></br>
                
                
                So now I have no choice but to stay far</br>
                I stay far and admire your beauty</br>
                It is impeccable and pulls me </br>
                I have no control</br>
                Why do you have to be so beautiful?</br></br></br>
                
                
                
                Why do you have such thorns?</br>
                It is beyond my comprehension</br>
                How can something so beautiful have thorns</br>
                I am still in shock; how could this be?</br>
                But I know through experience that you are very thorny</br>
                For you have pricked me and poked far too deep</br>
                For I have bleed so hard from your thorns</br></br></br>
                
                
                Even though your thorns have hurt me</br>
                I still admire your beauty</br>
                Is this madness or foolishness</br>
                Is this loving your worst enemy</br>
                Even when you know they are plotting to kill you</br>
                How can such a strange feeling arise and torture me?</br>
                All my life I have completely loved someone</br>
                Or I have completely hated them</br></br></br>
                
                
                But never been in such a pathetic state</br>
                Loving your worst enemy</br>
                Admiring the worst that you could find on earth</br>
                How could such a feeling exist?</br>
                Staying far from your thorns has stopped the bleeding</br>
                But I am still too damaged and hurting</br></br></br>
                
                
                But I got faith in myself</br>
                For I shall recover and heal</br>
                For I shall accept you and let you go</br>
                For I shall forgive you and forget you</br>
                Goodbye my beautiful thorny rose!.</p>
