<h1>THORNY ROSE!! WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO BEAUTIFUL??</h1>

<img src="./assets/images/IMG_1872 Medium.jpeg" alt="rose flower" />
<p>
   
                I wish you were not so beautiful</br>
Then I would not be drawn to you</br>
I would not have learnt that you have thorns all over you</br>
Wish I could only see your beautiful side</br>
Wish I could totally ignore your thorny side</br>
But it has impossible for me to do that</br></br></br>


So now I have no choice but to stay far</br>
I stay far and admire your beauty</br>
It is impeccable and pulls me </br>
I have no control</br>
Why do you have to be so beautiful?</br></br></br>



Why do you have such thorns?</br>
It is beyond my comprehension</br>
How can something so beautiful have thorns</br>
I am still in shock; how could this be?</br>
But I know through experience that you are very thorny</br>
For you have pricked me and poked far too deep</br>
For I have bleed so hard from your thorns</br></br></br>


Even though your thorns have hurt me</br>
I still admire your beauty</br>
Is this madness or foolishness</br>
Is this loving your worst enemy</br>
Even when you know they are plotting to kill you</br>
How can such a strange feeling arise and torture me?</br>
All my life I have completely loved someone</br>
Or I have completely hated them</br></br></br>


But never been in such a pathetic state</br>
Loving your worst enemy</br>
Admiring the worst that you could find on earth</br>
How could such a feeling exist?</br>
Staying far from your thorns has stopped the bleeding</br>
But I am still too damaged and hurting</br></br></br>


But I got faith in myself</br>
For I shall recover and heal</br>
For I shall accept you and let you go</br>
For I shall forgive you and forget you</br>
Goodbye my beautiful thorny rose!
