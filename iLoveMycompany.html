    <h1>I LOVE MY COMPANY!</h1>

    <p>

        I love my company more than I thought. I am silly and funny and like to spend time watching romantic TV series. I am lighthearted and do not like painful stories. I don’t like watching violence and negative things. I am a dreamer and like to dream and imagine of a place where everyone is peaceful, and everything is in harmony.  I like to dream of a place where everything is fair, and no one is controlled or crushed. I know it sounds too ridiculous but as I said I am a dreamer and I have lived in la-la land for most of my life wanting such a world. </br></br></br>

        But now that I have reached forty, I am not naïve to believe such a world exist. The world that exists is not perfect nor all peaceful. But it is still a beautiful and a wonderful place to live. There are few things which may not be the way I like, but I have learnt to pick and choose the things I like and leave the rest. I have learnt not to judge and let others live their lives however they please.</br></br></br>
        
        
        I like my company because I am constantly growing and wanting new things in life. I like my company because I always look for a harmonious place to rest and call it home. I like my company because I like to keep things simple and clean. Also, I like my company because I don’t like to lie and scheme and waste my energy on useless things.</br></br></br>
        
        
        I like my company because I like to do silly fun things and enjoy comedy too. I like my company because I care about myself and constantly pulling myself out of sticky situations. I like my company because no matter how crazy I get; I still love myself and won’t give up. I like my company because no matter how damaged, I still pick myself up and have faith in myself. Overall, I will go to hell and above to get what I want, such is my love for myself. So, there is no best company other than me. This is to say all humans have their first and best company which is themselves. Then comes along everyone else and its glorious. I love it!
