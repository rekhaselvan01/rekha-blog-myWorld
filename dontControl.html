    <h1>DO NOT CONTROL</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/IMG_3917 Medium.jpeg" alt="rose flower" />
    <p>
    I needed to have the taste of my own medicine. I needed to realize that I was controlling everyone in my life in the name of love, but I was unaware of it. 
    I didn’t know what I was doing to them.But now after facing the same situation myself, I finally realized that I have tried to control them, and I was wrong.</br></br></br>
    
    I even tried to control the kids. I even tried to control others and outside situations. 
    I regret it so much. I am so sorry everyone. I am so sorry. Please forgive me.</br></br></br>

    First time in life, I realized that just because someone loves you it doesn’t mean you own them.
    It doesn’t mean you can control them. By doing so you lose them and lose their love too. </br></br></br>

        Lesson:

    If someone loves you, please treasure them, don’t force them and don’t control them. 
    If you do that then it doesn’t matter how much you love them, you are going to lose them. 
    Never do this mistake again with anyone.
