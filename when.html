    <img src="./assets/images/IMG_2709 Medium.jpeg" alt="rose flower" />
    <p>

        When will it stop hurting?</br>
Will there ever be a time when it won’t hurt anymore?</br>
Why am I bleeding so hard?</br>
How long will it hurt before I become numb to this pain?</br></br></br>

When will it stop hurting?</br>
Can someone please share this pain with me?</br>
For it’s too much for me to bear alone.</br>
Never been cut so deep and never seems to heal </br></br></br>

When will it stop hurting?</br>
How much of a sinner am I to endure such pain all in the name of love?</br>
How much should I cry to bear this pain?</br></br></br>


Someone o someone please tell me how to find peace?</br>
My little heart is broken and will not mend no matter what I do </br>
Why can’t I just let it go, and find peace?</br></br></br>

When will it stop hurting?</br>
Where can I find the strength to keep my innocence and faith?</br>
How long and how much before it stops hurting?</br>
Someone o someone please tell me how to find peace.
