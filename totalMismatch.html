    <h1>TOTAL MISMATCH</h1>
    <p>
        We are a total mismatch!!!</br>
        We have nothing in common</br>
        Our commonality is a null set</br>
        We are like north and south pole</br>
        We can never be together</br></br></br>


        We are two parallel lines </br>
        We run near each other all lives but can never meet</br>
        I like harmony and you like chaos</br>
        I like order and you like random</br>
        I like principles and you like none.</br>
        I like equality and you like control.</br></br></br>

        We are like a dream</br>
        We can wish and dream all we want</br>
        But we can never be real.</br>
        We are like day and night.</br>
        When one is there, other is missing.</br>
        When one is happy, other is unhappy.</br>

        We should have never met.</br>
        I want to go back to a time when I didn’t know you.</br>
        I want to go back to a place where I was all me.</br>
        I want to go back to a place where I can forget myself.</br>
        I wish I could lose all my memory and become blank.</br>
        I regret meeting you.</br>
        I desperately want to undo everything that happened with you.</br></br></br>


        Want to go back to a place where I did not know you</br>
        Want my happiness back.</br>
        Want my peace back.</br>
        Want my privacy back.</br></br></br>


        Want my freedom of thought back.</br>
        Want my freedom of action back.</br>
        Want to say goodbye and never you meet again for the rest of my life.</br>
        GOOOD BYE! let’ never meet again.</p>
